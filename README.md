# Finding Lane Lines on the Road
![](resources/final-video-capture.png)

## Introduction
In this project we are going to detect lane line on the road. Inputs were provided as a video clips and annotations were done with provided input road images. Our goal to detect lane line using annotated road images. Following learning objectives will be covered from this projects.

* Basic usage of OpenCV Python APIs
* Basic image processing techniques such as colour scale changes, colour selection, bluring images
* Images edge detection using Canny edge detector (OpenCV will be used to apply these theories)
* Required images' region selection. Both hard coded and dynamic selections will be used
* Hough tranfomation line detection (OpenCV will be used to appy these alogorithnms)

This project consits of following major files and folders.
* Finding_Lane_Lines_on_the_Road.ipynb - **The IPython notebook file**
* Finding_Lane_Lines_on_the_Road.html - **A extracted HTML file from notebook**
* READMED.md - **Writeup for this project**
* test_images - **Test images directory**
* test_videos - **Test videos directory**
* test_videos_output - **Output directory**
* opencv - **Sample OpenCV works**
* resources - **Required images for writeup**
